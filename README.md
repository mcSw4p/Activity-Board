# Activity Board

This project is still a work of progress.

Activity Board is a project created to keep track of active devices in your network. It provides a nice UI to easily view if a device
is active or inactive. 

I made this project for use with Google Chromecast, you can cast the tab you view Activity Board in if it's Chrome, to your Chromecast.
This makes it easy to display so you and others can see the statuses.
